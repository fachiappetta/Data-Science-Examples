## Project Objective

In this project, you will build supervised learning models for one regression and one classification problem following guided prompts and evaluate those models using train/test splits.

This project includes **required** and **bonus** objectives. You only need to complete the **required** portions, but you're encouraged to try as many of the bonus questions as possible!

## Project Requirements

In a Jupyter Notebook, create working solutions for all of the **required** questions. Your notebook should include:

1. Text for each question, copy and pasted from the starter code provided.
2. A working solution to each problem.
   - Do not include test, practice, or broken code (*unless you were unable to create a working solution*).
3. Comments for all of your code.
   - In your comments, describe any assumptions you made in order to solve these problems.
4. **Bonus**:
    - After completing the required portions, try your hand at the **bonus** sections for some additional challenges!
    - Submit a model for [the Titanic dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic). This process will get you familiar with the Kaggle platform, which may be the best place to hone your machine learning skills.

## Grading

Instructors will provide comments on your work. Grading is pass/fail. You will be given a second chance if you make a good-faith effort that misses the mark, but you will be in much better shape if you put in the work up front to pass on the first try.
