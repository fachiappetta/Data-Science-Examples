You will complete a series of exercises exploring [the top-rated movies on IMDB](./data/imdb_1000.csv), an online database of film info and reviews.

## Project Requirements

Create working solutions for all of the relevant questions in `imdb.ipynb`. Include comments that explain any non-obvious choices or assumptions you made in order to solve these problems.

**BONUS**: After completing our challenges, go back and see if you can think of any other valid methods.

## Grading

Instructors will provide comments on your work. Grading is pass/fail. You will be given a second chance if you make a good-faith effort that misses the mark, but you will be in much better shape if you put in the work up front to pass on the first try.
